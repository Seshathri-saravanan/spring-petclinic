### Review Status:

This project has been reviewed by its creators.

### Review Comment:

There is no obvious relationship between the "comment" code in the "PetClinicApplication" Java file and the "main" method in "PetClinicApplication" Java file as "comment" code is not even included as a comment but included solely for unit testing.  There is a logical relationship between "comment" code included as comments in "PetClinicApplication" Java file and the "main" method in "PetClinicApplication" Java file, however that relationship is not evident from the "comment" code as "comment" code is not even included as a comment but included solely for unit testing.

### Recommended Change:
